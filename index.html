    <h4><strong>Project In Progress:</strong></h4>
    <p>Currently, I am leading a project with a team of three web designers in AWS Amplify, set to be completed by the end of 2023. 
      The project involves creating an interactive map of the fictional world from "One Piece," a popular pirate-themed series known for 
      its extensive adventures across numerous islands, spanning over 1000 episodes. Given the vastness of the series and the fanbase seeking 
      character locations at specific points within the storyline, our main objective is to establish a robust website-database connection. 
      This will enable us to precisely track the whereabouts of each character at any given time during the series.
      <br/><br/>
      Our vision for this initiative includes reaching out to the fan community through mediums like Reddit and Tik Tok, advertising the website with Google ads,
      and anticipating substantial daily traffic from thousands of viewers in order to produce revenue. 
      To achieve this, we are using a mixture of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js all within the AWS Amplify framework.
